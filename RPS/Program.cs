Title: 
Code RPS
  
  
  
Decription: 
In this game, you'll face off against the computer in a classic game of rock paper scissors, but with a twist: you'll be testing your knowledge of basic programming concepts!
To start, you'll be prompted to choose your weapon of choice: rock, paper or scissors. Once you've made your choice, the computer will randomly select its own weapon and the
two choices will be compared to determine the winner. if you're not familiar with the rules of rock paper scissors, here they are:

   * Rock beats scissors
   * Scissors beats paper
   * Paper beats rock
         
If you win, you'll be rewarded with a point and the opportunity to answer a question testing your coding skills and knowledge of basic programming concepts, if you answer the
question correctly you will be rewarded an additional point, but if you answer question incorrectly your opponent will have an opportunity to answer the question, if they answer
the question correctly they will be rewarded with a point. To add an extra challenge, you can set a time limit for each question. if you don't answer the question within the
time, you'll forfeit the round. There are 6 different opponents you can choose to challenge each one more skilled then the other. Think you can take all of them on? Give it a try
and see if you beat the computer!
